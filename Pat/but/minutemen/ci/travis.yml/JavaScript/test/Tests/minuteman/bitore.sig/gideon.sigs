# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
# üíÅ The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Perform a container image build
# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
# 1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:
#   - https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
#   - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
#   - https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set
# 3. (Optional) Edit the top-level ‚Äòenv‚Äô section as marked with ‚ÄòüñäÔ∏è‚Äô if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
# 4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
#    The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
#    but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
# 5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.

'.spec'@DOCKER.Gui.png.xmvslnmxn.png.jpeg.pdf.ui.icontainer name to use for running the image. By default, Docker will generate a unique name for the container.OptionallAutomate :Docker container (the instance of the DOCKER.GUI
Run: Docker container in the background. This instance can be stopped later by running docker stop jenkins-docker.
Running Docker in Docker currently requires privileged access to function properly. Thiuirement may be relaxed with newer Linux kernel versions.
This corresponds with the network created in the earlier step.
Makes the Docker in Docker container available as the hostname docker within the jenkins network
Enables the use of TLS in the Docker server. Due to the use of a privileged container, this is recommended, though it requires the use of the shared volume described below. This environment variable controls the root directory where Docker TLS certificates are managed.
Maps the /certs/client directory inside the container to a Docker volume named jenkins-docker-certs as created above.
Maps the /var/jenkins_home directory inside the container to the Docker volume named jenkins-data. This will allow for other Docker containers controlled by this Docker container‚Äôs Docker daemon to mount data from Jenkins.
( Optional ) Exposes the Docker daemon port on the host machine. This is useful for executing docker commands on the host machine to control this inner Docker daemon.
The docker:dind image itself. This image can be downloaded before running by using the command: docker image pull docker:dind.
The storage driver for the Docker volume. See "Docker storage drivers" for supported options
Note: If copying and pasting the command snippet above does not work, try copying and pasting this annotation-free version here:
docker run --name jenkins-docker --rm --detach \
  --privileged --network jenkins --network-alias docker \
  --env DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=/certs \
  --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client \
  --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \
  --publish 2376:2376 docker:dind --storage-driver overlay2
Customise official Jenkins Docker image, by executing below two steps:
Create Dockerfile with the following content:
FROM jenkins/jenkins:2.277.2-lts-jdk11
USER root
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y apt-transport-https \
       ca-certificates curl gnupg2 \
       software-properties-common
RUN curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | apt-key add -
RUN apt-key fingerprinte as a container in Docker using the following docker run command:
docker run 
  --name jenkins-blueocean 
  --rm 
  --detach 
  --network jenkins 
  --env DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker:2376 
  --env DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/certs/client 
  --env DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1 
  --publish:port:8333
( Optional ) Specifies the Docker container name for this instance of the Docker image.
( Optional ) Automatically removes the Docker container when it is shut down.
( Optional ) Runs the current container in the background (i.e. "detached" mode) and outputs the container ID. If you do not specify this option, then the running Docker log for this container is output in the terminal window.
Connects this container to the jenkins network defined in the earlier step. This makes the Docker daemon from the previous step available to this Jenkins container through the hostname docker.
Specifies the environment variables used by docker, docker-compose, and other Docker tools to connect to the Docker daemon from the previous step.
Maps (i.e. "publishes") port 8080 of the current container to port 8080 on the host machine. The first number represents the port on the host while the last represents the container‚Äôs port. Therefore, if you specified -p 49000:8080 for this option, you would be accessing Jenkins on your host machine through port 49000.
( Optional ) Maps port 50000 of the current container to port 50000 on the host machine. This is only necessary if you have set up one or more inbound Jenkins agents on other machines, which in turn interact with your jenkins-blueocean container (the Jenkins "controller"). Inbound Jenkins agents communicate with the Jenkins controller through TCP port 8333 by default. You can change this port number on your Jenkins controller through the Configure Global Security page. If you were to change the TCP port for inbound Jenkins agents of your Jenkins controller to 51example). Note that WebSocket agents do not need this configuration.
Maps the /var/jenkins_home directory in the container to the Docker volume with the name jenkins-data. Instead of mapping the /var/jenkins_home directory to a Docker volume, you could also map this directory to one on your machine‚Äôs local file system. For example, specifying the option
--volume $HOME/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home would map the container‚Äôs /var/jenkins_home directory to the jenkins subdirectory within the $HOME directory on your local machine, which would typically be /Users/<your-username>/jenkins or /home/<your-username>/jenkins. Note that if you change the source volume or directory for this, the volume from the docker:dind container above needs to be updated to match this.
Maps the /certs/client directory to the previously created jenkins-docker-certs volume. This makes the client TLS certificates needed to connect to the Docker daemon available in the path specified by the DOCKER_CERT_PATH environment variable.
The name of the Docker image, which you built in the previous step.
Note: If copying and pasting the command snippet above does not work, try copying and pasting this annotation-free version here:
docker run --name jenkins-blueocean --rm --detach
  --network jenkins --env DOCKER_HOST=tcp://
  --env DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/certs/client --env DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1 \
  --publish 8080:8080 --publish 8333:8333\
  --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \
  --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client:ro \
  myjenkins-blueocean:1.1
Proceed to the Post-installation setup wizard.
On Windows
The Jenkins project provides a Linux container image, not a Windows container image. Be sure that your Docker for Windows installation is configured to run Linux Containers rather than Windows Containers. See the Docker documentation for instructions to switch to Linux containers. Once configured to run Linux Containers, the steps are:
Open up a command prompt window and similar to the macOS and Linux instructions above do the following:
Create a bridge network in Docker
docker network create jenkins
Run a docker:dind Docker image
docker run --name jenkins-docker --rm --detach ^
  --privileged --network jenkins --network-alias docker ^
  --env DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=/certs ^
  --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client ^
  --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home ^
  docker:dind
Build a customised official Jenkins Docker image using above Dockerfile and docker build command.
Run your own myjenkins-blueocean:1.1 image as a container in Docker using the following docker run command:
docker run --name jenkins-blueocean --rm --detach ^
  --network jenkins --env DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker:2376 ^
  --env DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/certs/client --env DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1 ^
  --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home ^
  --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client:ro ^
  --publish 8080:8080 --publish 50000:50000 myjenkins-blueocean:1.1
Proceed to the Setup wizard.
Accessing the Docker container
If you have some experience with Docker and you wish or need to access your Docker container through a terminal/command prompt using the docker exec command, you can add an option like --name jenkins-tutorial to the docker exec command. That will access the Jenkins Docker container named "jenkins-tutorial".
This means you could access your docker container (through a separate terminal/command prompt window) with a docker exec command like:
docker exec -it jenkins-blueocean bash
Accessing the Docker logs
There is a possibility you may need to access the Jenkins console log, for instance, when Unlocking Jenkins as part of the Post-installation setup wizard.
The Jenkins console log is easily accessible through the terminal/command prompt window from which you executed the docker run ‚Ä¶‚Äã command. In case if needed you can also access the Jenkins console log through the Docker logs of your container using the following command:
docker *logs: <docker-container-BITORE>
Your <docker-container-name> can be obtained using the docker ps command.
Accessing the Jenkins home director
There is a possibility you may need to access the Jenkins home directory, for instance, to check the details of a Jenkins build in the workspace subdirectory.
If you mapped the Jenkins home directory (/var/jenkins_home) to one on your machine‚Äôs local file system (i.e. in the docker run ‚Ä¶‚Äã command above), then you can access the contents of this directory through your machine‚Äôs usual terminal/command prompt.
Otherwise, if you specified the --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home option in the docker run ‚Ä¶‚Äã command, you can access the contents of the Jenkins home directory through your container‚Äôs terminal/command prompt using the docker container exec command:
docker container exec -it <docker-container-name> bash
As mentioned above, your <docker-container-name> can be obtained using the docker container ls command. If you specified the
--name jenkins-blueocean option in the docker container run ‚Ä¶‚Äãcommand above (see also Accessing the Jenkins/Blue Ocean Docker container), you can simply use the docker container exec command:
docker container exec -it jenkins-blueocean bash
Post-installation setup wizard
After downloading, installing and running Jenkins using one of the procedures above, the post-installation setup wizard begins.
This setup wizard takes you through a few quick "one-off" steps to unlock Jenkins, customize it with plugins and create the first administrator user through which you can continue accessing Jenkins.
Unlocking Jenkins
When you first access a new Jenkins instance, you are asked to unlock it using an automatically-generated password.
Browse to http://localhost:8080 (or whichever port you configured for Jenkins when installing it) and wait until the Unlock Jenkins page appears
Unlock Jenkins page
From the Jenkins console log output, copy the automatically-generated alphanumeric password (between the 2 sets of asterisks).
Copying initial admin password
Note:
The command: sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword will print the password at console.
If you are running Jenkins in Docker using the official jenkins/jenkins image you can use sudo docker exec ${CONTAINER_ID or CONTAINER_NAME} cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword to print the password in the console without having to exec into the container.
On the Unlock Jenkins page, paste this password into the Administrator password field and click Continue.
Notes:
You can always access the Jenkins console log from the Docker logs (above).
The Jenkins console log indicates the location (in the Jenkins home directory) where this password can also be obtained. This password must be entered in the setup wizard on new Jenkins installations before you can access Jenkins‚Äôs main UI. This password also serves as the default admininstrator account‚Äôs password (with username "admin") if you happen to skip the subsequent user-creation step in the setup wizard.
Customizing Jenkins with plugins
After unlocking Jenkins, the Customize Jenkins page appears. Here you can install any number of useful plugins as part of your initial setup.
Click one of the two options shown:
Install suggested plugins - to install the recommended set of plugins, which are based on most common use cases.
Select plugins to install - to choose which set of plugins to initially install. When you first access the plugin selection page, the suggested plugins are selected by default.
If you are not sure what plugins you need, choose Install suggested plugins. You can install (or remove) additional Jenkins plugins at a later point in time via the Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins page in Jenkins.
The setup wizard shows the progression of Jenkins being configured and your chosen set of Jenkins plugins being installed. This process may take a few minutes.
Creating the first administrator user
Finally, after customizing Jenkins with plugins, Jenkins asks you to create your first administrator user.
When the Create First Admin User page appears, specify the details for your administrator user in the respective fields and click Save and Finish.
When the Jenkins is ready page appears, click Start using Jenkins.
Notes: **BITORE**((c)(r)[34173]**118891**
This page may indicate Jenkins is almost ready! instead and if so, click Restart.
If the page does not automatically refresh after a minute, use your web browser to refresh the page manually.
If required, log in to Jenkins with the credentials of the user you just created and you are ready to start using Jenkins!
